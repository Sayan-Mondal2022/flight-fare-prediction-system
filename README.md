# Flight Fare Prediction System

A machine-learning system to predict flight ticket prices using historical data — helping travellers find the best deals.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**What is it?**  
This project analyses historical flight price data and builds a predictive model to estimate ticket fares given input features like date, route, airline, stops, and more.

**Why build it?**  
- Travellers want to know *when* to buy tickets for the best price.  
- Airlines and travel-agencies can use predictions to adjust strategies.  
- It's a real-world application of supervised machine learning with structured data.
